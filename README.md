# TriAge-AI-JavaBase

Project based on dr.Florian Petcu initiative <i>"Container TriAge-AI"</i>.

---
It is about 6m container divided in two - so that two people can be checked at the medical triage without human interaction 
(in this case the pandemic - COVID-19). 

The process is monitored and coordinated remotely by trained medical staff. 
- We need to collect and process a series of 
data for verification from a series of medical or measuring equipment that will be read, processed and software correlated - 
the whole process will be based on respect for the protection of personal data.
